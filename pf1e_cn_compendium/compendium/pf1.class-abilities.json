The gunslinger still takes the 閳? penalty on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;for each range increment beyond the first when she performs this deed.</p>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Gunslinger閳ユ獨 Dodge (Ex):</em> At 1st level, the gunslinger gains an uncanny knack for getting out of the way of ranged attacks. When a ranged attack is made against the gunslinger, she can spend 1 grit point to move 5 feet as an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>; doing so grants the gunslinger a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. This movement is not a 5-foot step, and provokes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. Alternatively, the gunslinger can drop&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a> to gain a +4 bonus to AC against the triggering attack. The gunslinger can only perform this deed while wearing medium or light armor, and while carrying no more than a light load.</p>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Quick Clear (Ex):</em> At 1st level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the gunslinger can remove the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Broken\">broken</a>&nbsp;condition from a single firearm she is currently wielding, as long as that condition was gained by a firearm misfire. The gunslinger must have at least 1 grit point to perform this deed. Alternatively, if the gunslinger spends 1 grit point to perform this deed, she can perform quick clear as a move-equivalent action instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.</p>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Gunslinger Initiative (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, as long as the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the following benefits. First, she gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;checks. Furthermore, if she has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/quick-draw-combat\">Quick Draw</a>&nbsp;feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and the firearm is not hidden, she can draw a single firearm as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;check.</p>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Pistol-Whip (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, the gunslinger can make a surprise melee attack with the butt or handle of her firearm as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. When she does, she is considered to be proficient with the firearm as a melee weapon and gains a bonus on the attack and damage rolls equal to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus\">enhancement bonus</a>&nbsp;of the firearm. The damage dealt by the pistol-whip is of the bludgeoning type, and is determined by the size of the firearm. One-handed firearms deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if wielded by Small creatures) and two-handed firearms deal 1d10 points of damage (1d8 if wielded by Small creatures). Regardless of the gunslinger閳ユ獨 size, the critical multiplier of this attack is 20/鑴?. If the attack hits, the gunslinger can make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check to knock the target&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>. Performing this deed costs 1 grit point.</p>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Utility Shot (Ex):</em> At 3rd level, if the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she can perform all of the following utility shots. Each utility shot can be applied to any single attack with a firearm, but the gunslinger must declare the utility shot she is using before firing the shot.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blast Lock:</em> The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against a lock within the first range increment of her firearm. A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality. A simple lock has a +10 bonus to AC, an average lock has a +15 bonus to AC, a good lock has a +20 bonus to AC, and a superior lock has a +30 bonus to AC.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-lock\">Arcane lock</a>&nbsp;grants a +10 bonus to the AC of a lock against this attack. On a hit, the lock is destroyed, and the object can be opened as if it were unlocked. On a miss, the lock is destroyed, but the object is jammed and still considered locked. It can still be unlocked by successfully performing this deed, by using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;skill, or with the break DC, though the DC for either break or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;or the AC increases by 10. A key, combination, or similar mechanical method of unlocking the lock no longer works, though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/k/knock\">knock</a>&nbsp;can still be employed to bypass the lock, and the creator of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/arcane-lock\">arcane lock</a>&nbsp;can still bypass the wards of that spell.</li>\n<li><em>Scoot Unattended Object: </em>The gunslinger makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;against a Tiny or smaller unattended object within the first range increment of her firearm. A Tiny unattended object has an AC of 5, a Diminutive unattended object has an AC of 7, and a Fine unattended object has an AC of 11. On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot閳ユ獨 origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.</li>\n<li><em>Stop Bleeding: </em>The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound. Instead of dealing damage, the shot ends a single&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;condition affecting the creature. The gunslinger does not have to make an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;when performing the deed in this way; she can instead shoot the firearm into the air, but that shot still uses up ammunition normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Dead Shot (Ex):</em> At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, the gunslinger can take careful aim and pool all of her attack potential into a single, deadly shot. When she does this, she shoots the firearm at a single target, but makes as many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;as she can, based on her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>. She makes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;in order from highest bonus to lowest, as if she were making a full attack. If any of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;hit the target, the gunslinger閳ユ獨 single attack is considered to have hit. For each additional successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;beyond the first, the gunslinger increases the damage of the shot by the base damage dice of the firearm. For instance, if a 7th-level gunslinger firing a musket hits with both attacks, she does 2d12 points of damage with the shot, instead of 1d12 points of damage, before adding any damage modifiers. Precision damage and extra damage from weapon special abilities (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons#TOC-Flaming\">flaming</a>) are added with damage modifiers and are not increased by this deed. If one or more rolls are critical threats, she confirms the critical once using her highest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;閳?. For each critical threat beyond the first, she reduces this penalty by 1 (to a maximum of 0). The gunslinger only misfires on a dead shot if all the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;are misfires. She cannot perform this deed with a blunderbuss or other scatter weapon when attacking creatures in a cone. The gunslinger must spend 1 grit point to perform this deed.</p>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Startling Shot (Ex): </em>At 7th level, a gunslinger with least 1 grit point can spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;to purposely miss a creature that she could normally hit with a firearm attack. When she does, that creature becomes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\">flat-footed</a>&nbsp;until the start of its next turn.</p>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Targeting (Ex):</em> At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, the gunslinger can make a single firearm attack and choose part of the body to target. She gains the following effects depending on the part of the body targeted. If a creature does not have one of the listed body locations, that part cannot be targeted. This deed costs 1 grit point to perform no matter which part of the creature she targets. Creatures that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack\">sneak attacks</a>&nbsp;are immune to these effects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Arms:</em> On a hit, the target takes no damage from the hit but drops one carried item of the gunslinger閳ユ獨 choice, even if the item is wielded with two hands. Items held in a locked gauntlet are not dropped on a hit.</li>\n<li><em>Head:</em> On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and is also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Confused\">confused</a>&nbsp;for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect.</li>\n<li><em>Legs:</em> On a hit, the target is damaged normally and knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>. Creatures that have four or more legs or that are immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip\">trip</a>&nbsp;attacks are immune to this effect.</li>\n<li><em>Torso:</em> Targeting the torso threatens a critical on a 19閳?0.</li>\n<li><em>Wings:</em> On a hit, the target is damaged normally, and must make a DC 20&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly\">Fly</a>&nbsp;check or fall 20 ft.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Bleeding Wound (Ex):</em> At 11th level, when the gunslinger hits a living creature with a firearm attack, she can spend 1 grit point as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;to have that attack deal extra&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage. The amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Bleed\">bleed</a>&nbsp;damage is equal to the gunslinger閳ユ獨&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier.

If she has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/rapid-reload-combat\">Rapid Reload</a>&nbsp;feat or is using an alchemical cartridge (or both), she can reload a single barrel of the weapon as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>&nbsp;each round instead. Furthermore, using this deed does not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>.</p>\n<p>&emsp;&emsp;<em>Evasive (Ex): </em>At 15th level, when the gunslinger has at least 1 grit point, she gains the benefit of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">improved uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogue</a>&nbsp;class features.

To keep up this charade, the vigilante usually has two names: his true name, used in polite company, and his vigilante name, used to strike fear in the hearts of those who oppose him. Knowledge checks about one do not reveal information about the other, unless the vigilante閳ユ獨 true identity revealed to the world at large.<br><br>The vigilante can start each day in either of his identities, referred to simply as social or vigilante. Changing from one identity to another takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures to preserve the vigilante閳ユ獨 secret. Changing identities is more than just changing outfits and clothing (although that is certainly a part of it); the process often also involves applying make-up, altering his hair, and adjusting other personal effects. Furthermore, the change is as much a state of mind as of body, so items such as a hat of disguise and similar spells and effects that change the user閳ユ獨 appearance do not reduce the time required to change identities. Most social talents require the vigilante to be in his social identity, but a vigilante who uses vigilante talents in his social identity risks exposing his secret.<br><br>Despite being a single person, a vigilante閳ユ獨 dual nature allows him to have two alignments, one for each of his identities. When in an identity, he is treated as having that identity閳ユ獨 alignment for all spells, magic items, and abilities that rely on alignment. For the purpose of meeting a qualification for a feat, class, or any ability, he is only eligible if both of his alignments meet the requirements. A vigilante閳ユ獨 two alignments cannot be more than one step from each other on a single alignment axis. For example, a vigilante with a lawful neutral social identity could have a vigilante identity that is lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, neutral, neutral good, or neutral evil. If a vigilante is the target of an effect that would change his alignment, it changes both of his alignments to the new alignment.<br><br>Any attempts to scry or otherwise locate the vigilante work only if the vigilante is currently in the identity the creature is attempting to locate (or if the creature knows that the two identities are the same individual).

Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed.<br><br>The first type of bond allows the antipaladin to enhance his weapon as a standard action by calling upon the aid of a fiendish spirit for 1 minute per antipaladin level. When called, the spirit causes the weapon to shed unholy light as a torch. At 5th level, this spirit grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every three levels beyond 5th, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +6 at 20th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon bonuses to a maximum of +5, or they can be used to add any of the following weapon properties:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Anarchic\">anarchic</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flaming\">flaming</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Flaming Burst\">flaming burst</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Keen\">keen</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Speed\">speed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Unholy\">unholy</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vicious\">vicious</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Vorpal\">vorpal</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wounding\">wounding</a>. Adding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's cost. These bonuses are added to any properties the weapon already has, but duplicate abilities do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. The bonus and properties granted by the spirit are determined when the spirit is called and cannot be changed until the spirit is called again. The fiendish spirit imparts no bonuses if the weapon is held by anyone other than the antipaladin but resumes giving bonuses if returned to the antipaladin. These bonuses apply to only one end of a double weapon. An antipaladin can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 5th, to a total of four times per day at 17th level.<br><br>If a weapon bonded with a fiendish spirit is destroyed, the antipaladin loses the use of this ability for 30 days, or until he gains a level, whichever comes first. During this 30-day period, the antipaladin takes a 閳? penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.<br><br>The second type of bond allows an antipaladin to gain the service of a fiendish servant. This functions as @Compendium[pf1.spells.1zmn8vqy3s5l9kiv]{召唤怪物 III}, except the duration is permanent and the antipaladin can only gain the service of a single creature and that creature must either have the chaotic and evil subtypes or it must be a fiendish animal.

The outsider is bound for up to 10 minutes. During this time, the occultist can bargain with the outsider for one piece of information.

The bargaining requires the occultist to attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check opposed by the outsider閳ユ獨 Sense Motive check. Succeeding at the check by 5 or more reduces this cost to 10 gp. Failure increases the price to 30 gp, whereas failure by 5 or more allows the outsider to escape without giving any information (or receiving payment).

Delivery typically takes 1d4 hours, but this period is reduced to 1d6 minutes if the recipient is within 1 mile of the occultist (or even less if the recipient is within sight).

			"description": "<p>&emsp;&emsp;A spiritualist begins play with the aid of a powerful and versatile spirit entity called a phantom. The phantom forms a link with the spiritualist, who forever after can either harbor the creature within her consciousness or manifest it as an ectoplasmic or incorporeal entity. A phantom has the same alignment as the spiritualist, and it can speak all the languages its master can. A spiritualist can harbor her phantom in her consciousness, manifest it partially, or fully manifest it. A fully manifested phantom is treated as a summoned creature from the Ethereal Plane, except it is not sent back to the Ethereal Plane until it is reduced to a negative amount of hit points equal to or greater than its Constitution score.<br><br>A spiritualist can fully manifest her phantom through a ritual that takes 1 minute to perform. When the phantom is fully manifested, the spiritualist can change the form of the phantom閳ユ獨 manifestation (either from ectoplasmic to incorporeal or vice versa) as a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. When the phantom manifests, its hit points are unchanged from the last time it manifested, unless the phantom was slain and returned to the Ethereal Plane; in this case, the phantom manifests with half its maximum number of hit points. The phantom does not heal naturally, and can be healed only with magic or by being tended to with the Heal skill while fully manifested in ectoplasmic form. The phantom stays fully manifested until it is either returned to the spiritualist閳ユ獨 consciousness (a standard action) or banished to the Ethereal Plane. If the phantom is banished to the Ethereal Plane, it can閳ユ獩 return to the spiritualist閳ユ獨 consciousness or manifest again for 24 hours.<br><br>While fully manifested, a phantom can閳ユ獩 be returned to the Ethereal Plane by means of&nbsp;dispel magic, but spells such as&nbsp;dismissal&nbsp;and&nbsp;banishment&nbsp;work normally. Whenever the spiritualist is unconscious or asleep, the phantom immediately returns to the spiritualist閳ユ獨 consciousness. If the spiritualist dies, the phantom is returned to the Ethereal Plane, and can閳ユ獩 return to the spiritualist閳ユ獨 consciousness until 24 hours after the spiritualist is brought back to life. A phantom can閳ユ獩 be dismissed or banished (by a spell or any other similar effect) while it resides in the spiritualist閳ユ獨 consciousness, as the phantom is protected from such effects by the power of the spiritualist閳ユ獨 psyche.<br><br>Fully manifested phantoms can wear armor and use items (though not wield weapons) appropriate to their forms. Any items worn, carried, or held by a phantom are dropped when the phantom returns to the spiritualist閳ユ獨 consciousness, and must be retrieved and donned anew if the phantom wishes to use them when it fully manifests in the future.<br><br>Phantoms are self-involved, even jealous, creatures that do not play well with other summoned companions. A phantom refuses to manifest (either fully or as part of a bonded manifestation) in the presence of an eidolon or shadow summoned by the phantom閳ユ獨 master. Furthermore, if a phantom is manifested when such a creature is summoned, it immediately retreats into its spiritualist閳ユ獨 consciousness, and will not manifest again until the eidolon or shadow is dismissed.<br><br>A fully manifested phantom閳ユ獨 abilities, feats, Hit Dice, saving throws, and skills are tied to the spiritualist閳ユ獨 class level and increase as the spiritualist gains levels.&nbsp;</p>"

While ronin are significantly freer to do as they please, they do not receive the same respect and support that a more dedicated samurai can count on. Note that cavaliers can select this order, but they are typically called knights errant instead of ronin.<br><br><strong>Becoming Ronin:</strong> Normally, when a samurai wishes to change his order, he must undergo a lengthy process that requires him to adhere to the edicts of his new order for a period of time before receiving any benefits. This is not the case with ronin. Once a samurai decides to become a ronin, he immediately loses all of the bonuses, skills, and abilities of his old order and gains those of the ronin order.
