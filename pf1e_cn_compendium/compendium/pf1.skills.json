(未完全受训的新手平均每天只能赚1银币)。</p>\n<p>工艺技能最基本的作用是让你可以制作出特定的物品，制作该物品的工艺检定DC取决于制作的复杂程度。工艺技能的DC、你的检定结果以及物品的价格三者同时决定了制造这件物品所需时间的长短。另外，物品的最终售价还受到其所使用原材料的影响。</p>\n<p>如果一个制造者施放法术‘鬼斧神工 (fabricate)’，他可以无需投骰直接获得工艺检定的结果。不过如果试图制造一件工艺特别精致的物品，在使用法术之余你也需要进行适当的工艺技能检定。另外，你可以通过一个成功的工艺 (木工) 检定制造出一件木器，同时为其注入‘金刚木 (ironwood)’法术，使得这件普通的木器具有钢铁般的强度。如果你试图使用法术<a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"jsvjsax2eabrlx8g\"> 次级造物术</a>来制造一件复杂的物品，你也需要同时通过一个合适数值的工艺检定。</p>\n<p>所有的工艺技能都需要专业的工具来支持工作。如果你只能用临时拼凑的工具制造物品，那么你的工艺检定-2。而另一方面，使用精制品的工具会使你的工艺检定获得+2表现加值。</p>\n<p>在决定制造一件物品需要花费多少时间和金钱时，请按以下步骤进行计算：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>换算出此件物品的银币价格 (1gp = 10sp)；</li>\n<li>根据下表找出制造物品的工艺技能DC；</li>\n<li>支付1/3的物品价格作为原材料成本；</li>\n<li>进行一次工艺技能检定并工作一周。如果检定成功，将你获得的结果与DC相乘，相乘的结果如果等于该物品的银币价格，则你已完成该物品 (如果相乘的结果为银币价格的数倍，你可以依据此结果将制作时间减半或者更低)。如果相乘的结果低于物品的银币价格，那么你的工作没有完成，你需要下周再进行一次工艺检定并和原来的结果相加，直到这个数字等于物品的银币价格为止。</li>\n</ol>\n<p>如果你在工艺检定中失败并小于DC最多4点，你这周的工作将不会有任何成果；如果你失败并且小于DC至少5点，表明你不但失败还浪费了一半原材料，你必须重新支付原材料的一半。</p>\n<p><strong>每日进度：</strong> 你可以按日进行检定，而非按周。此种情况下你的进度 (检定结果×DC) 应除以每周的天数。</p>\n<p><strong>制作精制品：</strong> 你可以将这些物品制造为精制品——武器、护甲、盾牌或者用来进行特定工艺的专业工具。如果要制造一件精制品物品，你需要将它的精制品部分和普通的部分分开来计算。精制品的额外部分具有独立的价值 (武器300gp，盔甲和盾牌150gp，工具参见物品章节) 并且制造的工艺技能DC为20。只有在精制品部分与普通部分两方完成时，一件精制品物品才告完成。制造精制品部分所需的原材料成本要比普通的物品多花费1/3。</p>\n<p><strong>修复物品：</strong> 你可以用一项工艺技能修复一件物品，修复物品的技能检定DC等于其制造DC。修复物品须花费物品价格的1/5。</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td

href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 143</a><br>While antitoxin, as presented in the&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, presents a generalized tool for protecting oneself from poison, more specialized antivenoms can provide even greater protection against specific poisons. Creating a dose of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed to protect against.</p>\n<p><strong>Antivenom Effects:</strong> A single dose of antivenom automatically neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and provides a +8 alchemical 加值 on saving throws against additional exposure to that specific poison; this 加值 decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends after 8 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>工艺ing Antivenom:</strong> To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison’s effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison’s duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested.</p>\n<p>Once the creature has resisted the poison’s effects, a viable sample of the creature’s blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 工艺 (alchemy) or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful 工艺 (alchemy) check (DC = 5 + the poison’s saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom.</p>\n<p>Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.</p>\n<p><strong>Purchasing Antivenom:</strong> Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison.</p>\n<h1>Preserving Harvested Poison</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 143</a><br>Poison harvested from a creature or hazard remains potent for 24 hours. If a character wishes to preserve harvested poison for a longer period, she must treat it alchemically, as if crafting the poison with 工艺 (alchemy) but using the poison dose as the raw ingredients normally needed to brew a dose of the poison and thus avoiding the gp cost to craft the poison.</p>\n<h1>Salvaging</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 134</a><br>Foraging is one way to gather resources in the wild, but you can also recycle or repurpose items and gear as well, salvaging materials from items you no longer need or are willing to sacrifice. You can’t salvage materials from artifacts, cursed items, or items you can’t destroy. Successfully salvaging an item requires a 工艺 or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"uLZI2uWz0uB8UgBc\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Spellcraft</a> check and takes an amount of time as indicated in the specific type of salvage operation below.</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition:</strong> You can use destroyed ammunition as raw materials for new ammunition. Five pieces of destroyed ammunition provide suitable material to create one new piece of ammunition using the normal crafting rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Potions:</strong> If you have the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"nNVFVFRBCT4O2ab9\"> Brew Potion</a> feat, you can combine natural catalysts with a potion to salvage it and create a different potion of a lower spell level. Salvaging a potion requires raw magic item materials (these can be salvaged from existing items, as detailed below). To salvage a potion, you must spend 1 hour per spell level of the original potion and then attempt a 工艺 (alchemy) or Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 15 + 3 × the original potion’s spell level. If you succeed, you transmute the original potion into a new potion of a spell at least one spell level lower, provided you know the spell in question (it need not be one you can currently cast). If you fail this check by 4 or less, the attempt fails and the catalyst is wasted, but the potion is unharmed. If you fail by 5 or more, the raw materials are lost and the original potion is ruined.</p>\n<p><strong>Raw 工艺ing Materials:</strong> Anyone trained in the 工艺 skill can salvage raw materials from equipment for use in crafting or repair. You must carefully dismantle the item to be salvaged, resulting in the item’s destruction. If the item’s price is 1 gp or less, its materials can be salvaged with only 1 hour of work; otherwise it takes 8 hours to salvage crafting materials. A successful 工艺 check against the item’s creation DC + 5 yields raw materials worth one-quarter the item’s price. If you fail the 工艺 check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed but the materials can still be salvaged in a future attempt. If you fail the 工艺 check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the materials are ruined. Salvaged raw materials can be used to create or repair any item of the same materials and reduces the construction time by the proportion of the new item’s raw materials that are salvaged (minimum 8 hours).</p>\n<p><strong>Raw Magic Item Materials:</strong> Anyone with an item creation feat can salvage the raw materials from magic items for the creation of new ones or repair of existing ones. You must have the item creation feat required for that item to salvage its raw materials. Each attempt requires destroying a magic item and 8 hours of work. If the item’s price is 500 gp or less, you can salvage its materials in only 2 hours. A successful 工艺 or Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the item’s caster level yields raw materials worth two-thirds the creation cost of the destroyed item (one-third the market price). If you fail the skill check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed but the materials can still be salvaged in a future attempt. If you fail the skill check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the materials are ruined. Salvaged raw materials can be used to create or repair any item made of similar materials or that shares any of the creation requirements as the original. Including the majority of the materials allows you to automatically meet any construction requirements of a new item that the salvaged item also required and reduces the construction or repair time by the proportion of the new item’s construction materials that are salvaged (with the usual minimum creation time). Spellbooks and formula books can be salvaged for magic inks and paper usable in formula books, scrolls, and spellbooks.</p>\n<p><strong>Costly Spell Components:</strong> Anyone trained in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"uLZI2uWz0uB8UgBc\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Spellcraft</a> can salvage costly material or focus spell components from magic items. Each attempt requires destroying the item and 8 hours of work. An item can be broken down into a powder that can be used in place of gemstone dust as a material component. Otherwise, the item must have a spell requiring the component in its construction requirements to salvage that component. A successful <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"uLZI2uWz0uB8UgBc\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Spellcraft</a> check with a DC equal to 10 + the item’s caster level yields materials usable in place of that spell component worth two-thirds the item’s creation cost (one-third its market price). If you fail the check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed without yielding spell components, but you can try to salvage them again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the spell components are ruined.</p>\n<h1>科技</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy95d2?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Technology Guide pg. 5</a><br>Those who wish to construct or repair technological items use the 工艺 (mechanical) skill in conjunction with the technological item crafting feats. Without the Technologist feat, 工艺 (mechanical) can still be used to craft less advanced forms of technology such as gears, hinges, and pulleys.

The DC of this check depends on the creature’s starting attitude toward you, adjusted by its Charisma modifier. If you succeed, the character’s attitude toward you is improved by one step. For every 5 by which your check result exceeds the DC, the character’s attitude toward you increases by one additional step. A creature’s attitude cannot be shifted more than two steps up in this way, although the GM can override this rule in some situations.

This is an additional Diplomacy check, using the creature’s current attitude to determine the base DC, with one of the following modifiers. Once a creature’s attitude has shifted to helpful, the creature gives in to most requests without a check, unless the request is against its nature or puts it in serious peril.

To do this, you must spend at least 1d4 hours canvassing people at local taverns, markets, and gathering places. The DC of this check depends on the obscurity of the information sought, but for most commonly known facts or rumors it is 10. For obscure or secret knowledge, the DC might increase to 20 or higher. The GM might rule that some topics are simply unknown to common folk.</p>\n<p><strong>动作：</strong> Using Diplomacy to influence a creature’s attitude takes 1 minute of continuous interaction.

Calling for the guard requires a Diplomacy check modified by the settlement’s law modifier. It’s only a DC 5 check to call for the guard—with a success, the guards generally arrive on the scene in 1d6 minutes. Every 5 points by which the Diplomacy check exceeds DC 5 (rounding down) reduces the arrival time by 1 minute—if this reduces their arrival time below 1 minute, the increments of reduction instead change to 1轮. For example, Ezren is being mugged by thugs and calls for the guard. The result of his Diplomacy check is a 23, and the GM rolls a 2 on 1d6 to determine how long it’ll be before the guards arrive. Since Ezren rolled three times the amount he needed, the 2-minute wait time is reduced to 8轮.</p>\n<h2>Directing Crowds</h2>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/v5748btpy88yj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PRPG Core Rulebook pg. 436</a><br>It takes a DC 15 Diplomacy check or DC 20 <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"ImjhcPmm02QSCbPg\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Intimidate</a> check to convince a crowd to move in a particular direction, and the crowd must be able to hear or see the character making the attempt.

The DC of a Diplomacy check to hypnotize is 20 + the subject’s Will save modifier against mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects. All uses of hypnotism are mind-affecting enchantment (compulsion) effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Implant Suggestion:</strong> You can implant a suggested course of reasonable action in the mind of a willing creature, along with a defined trigger. To implant a suggestion, you spend 1 minute inducing a trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If the check is successful, you implant the course of action, as a&nbsp;suggestion&nbsp;spell with a duration of 10 minutes plus 10 additional minutes for every 1 by which your check result exceeds the DC. If the subject ceases to be willing, it can attempt a Will save once each轮 to shake off the effects. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Charisma modifier. You can attempt to subtly implant a suggestion in the mind of an unwilling creature with an attitude of indifferent or better after 1 minute of continuous, calm interaction with that creature, but the DC is 10 higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Recall Memory:</strong> You can draw out forgotten memories from a willing subject. You spend 1 minute inducing a calming, trance-like state in the subject, after which you attempt a Diplomacy check. If you succeed at the check, the hypnotized creature can reroll any previously failed Intelligence or Knowledge check to recall the forgotten information with a +4 加值. The information must be something the subject once knew or was exposed to.</p>\n<p><strong>动作：</strong> Hypnotism takes 1 minute of calm interaction.</p>\n<p><strong>重试：</strong> Yes. You can try to hypnotize the same creature more than once, but only once per day.</p>\n<h2>Occult Skill Unlocks</h2>\n<p>Characters capable of casting psychic spells or who have the Psychic Sensitivity feat gain access to skill unlocks—a host of esoteric skill uses not available to other PCs. These are not entirely new skills, but rather new uses of existing skills for those trained in the occult arts. A character must be trained in the appropriate skill to use that skill’s unlock, even if the skill can normally be used untrained. It’s impossible to take 10 for an occult skill unlock. Occult skill unlocks require intense concentration and strenuous effort, so the amount a character can use each skill unlock is limited to once per day or per week. This limit is for all uses of the skill unlock; if a character uses hypnotism to implant a suggestion, he can’t also use it to recall memories on the same day.</p>\n<h1>Unchained - 技能解放</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 83</a><br>With sufficient ranks in Diplomacy, you earn the following.</p>\n<p><strong>5点：</strong> The time required to influence a creature’s attitude or gather information is halved.</p>\n<p><strong>10点：</strong> You can attempt to adjust a creature’s attitude in 1轮 by taking a –10 penalty.

Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as two tricks.</li>\n<li><strong>Come (DC 15):</strong> The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.</li>\n<li><strong>Defend (DC 20):</strong> The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend another specific character.</li>\n<li><strong>Down (DC 15):</strong> The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.</li>\n<li><strong>Fetch (DC 15):</strong> The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches a random object.</li>\n<li><strong>Guard (DC 20):</strong> The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.</li>\n<li><strong>Heel (DC 15):</strong> The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.</li>\n<li><strong>Perform (DC 15):</strong> The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.</li>\n<li><strong>Seek (DC 15):</strong> The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay (DC 15):</strong> The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.</li>\n<li><strong>Track (DC 20):</strong> The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the scent ability.)</li>\n<li><strong>Work (DC 15):</strong> The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Train an Animal for a General Purpose:</strong> Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal’s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2 or higher.</p>\n<p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Combat Training (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes 6 weeks. You may also \"upgrade\" an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat by spending 3 weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal’s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Many horses and riding dogs are trained in this way.</li>\n<li><strong>Fighting (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes 3 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Guarding (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes 4 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy Labor (DC 15):</strong> An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes 2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Hunting (DC 20):</strong> An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes 6 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance (DC 15):</strong> An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes 5 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Riding (DC 15):</strong> An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes 3 weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rear a Wild Animal</strong>: To rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once.</p>\n<p>A successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it’s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.</p>\n<p><strong>动作：</strong> 可变. Handling an animal is a move action, while \"pushing\" an animal is a full-round action. (A druid or ranger can handle an animal companion as a free action or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.</p>\n<p><strong>重试：</strong> Yes, except for rearing an animal.</p>\n<p><strong>特殊：</strong> You can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do.</p>\n<p>A druid or ranger gains a +4 circumstance 加值 on Handle Animal checks involving an animal companion.</p>\n<p>In addition, a druid’s or ranger’s animal companion knows one or more 加值 tricks, which don’t count against the normal limit on tricks known and don’t require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.</p>\n<p>If you have the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"bqoIfsrF8BF1GC28\"> Animal Affinity</a> feat, you get a 加值 on Handle Animal checks (see Feats).</p>\n<p><strong>未受训:</strong> If you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can’t teach, rear, or train animals. A druid or ranger with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal companion, but she can’t teach, rear, or train other nondomestic animals.</p>\n<h1>Animal Tricks</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy8w7p?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Animal-Archive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Animal Archive pg. 8</a><br>Animal tricks are specific tasks you can teach an animal using the Handle Animal skill. The training process requires a week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against a listed DC. Successfully teaching an animal a trick includes teaching it some command that indicates it should perform the trick.</p>\n<p>An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. The Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook defines 12 tricks in the Handle Animal skill description (attack, come, defend, down, fetch, guard, heel, perform, seek, stay, track, and work) and seven general purposes (combat training, fighting, guarding, heavy labor, hunting, performance, and riding) that include various combinations of the existing tricks, yet these are not the only tasks animals can be trained to perform.</p>\n<h2>New Animal Tricks</h2>\n<p>The following new tricks can be taught to animals by training the animal for a week and making a successful Handle Animal skill check against the listed DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Aid (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;The animal can use the aid another action to aid a specific ally in combat by attacking a specific foe the ally is fighting. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to aid, and another that you want it make an attack roll against, and it will comply if able. The normal creature type restrictions governing the attack trick still apply.</p>\n<p><strong>Bombard (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;A flying animal can deliver projectiles on command, attempting to drop a specified item that it can carry (often alchemist’s fire or some other incendiary) on a designated point or opponent, using its base attack 加值 to determine its attack roll. The animal cannot throw the object, and must be able to fly directly over the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Break Out (DC 20):</strong> On command, the animal attempts to break or gnaw through any bars or bindings restricting itself, its handler, or a person indicated by the handler. If not effective on its own, this trick can grant the target character a +4 circumstance 加值 on <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"AOQsMtvLY4V3wFEL\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Escape Artist</a> checks. The animal can also take certain basic actions like lifting a latch or bringing its master an unattended key. Weight and Strength restrictions still apply, and pickpocketing a key or picking any sort of lock is still far beyond the animal’s ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Bury (DC 15):</strong>&nbsp;An animal with this trick can be instructed to bury an object in its possession. The animal normally seeks a secluded place to bury its object. An animal with both bury and fetch can be instructed to fetch an item it has buried.</p>\n<p><strong>Deliver (DC 15):</strong>&nbsp;The animal takes an object (one you or an ally gives it, or that it recovers with the fetch trick) to a place or person you indicate. If you indicate a place, the animal drops the item and returns to you. If you indicate a person, the animal stays adjacent to the person until the item is taken. (Retrieving an item from an animal using the deliver trick is a move action.)</p>\n<p><strong>Detect (DC 25):</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to seek out the smells of explosives and poisons, unusual noises or echoes, air currents, and other common elements signifying potential dangers or secret passages. When commanded, the animal uses its Perception skill to try to pinpoint the source of anything that strikes it as unusual about a room or location. Note that because the animal is not intelligent, any number of strange mechanisms, doors, scents, or unfamiliar objects may catch the animal’s attention, and it cannot attempt the same Perception check more than once in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Entertain (DC 25):</strong> The animal can dance, sing, or perform some other impressive and enjoyable trick to entertain those around it. At the command of its owner, the animal can make a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"HhV5UmaRLTjtB3Xh\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Perform</a> check (or a Charisma check if it has no ranks in Perform) to show off its talent. Willing onlookers or those who fail an opposed <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"R8HGxGCKayOl15AO\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Sense Motive</a> check take a –2 penalty on Perception checks to notice anything but the animal entertaining them. Tricksters and con artists often teach their animals to perform this trick while they pickpocket viewers or sneak about unnoticed.</p>\n<p><strong>Exclusive (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;The animal takes directions only from the handler who taught it this trick. If an animal has both the exclusive and serve tricks, it takes directions only from the handler that taught it the exclusive trick and those creatures indicated by the trainer’s serve command. An animal with the exclusive trick does not take trick commands from others even if it is friendly or helpful toward them (such as through the result of a&nbsp;charm animal&nbsp;spell), though this does not prevent it from being controlled by other enchantment spells (such as&nbsp;dominate animal), and the animal still otherwise acts as a friendly or helpful creature when applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>Flank (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;You can instruct an animal to attack a foe you point to and always attempt to be adjacent to (and threatening) that foe. If you or an ally is also threatening the foe, the animal attempts to flank the foe, if possible. It always takes attacks of opportunity. The animal must know the attack trick before it can learn this trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Flee (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;The animal attempts to run away or hide as best it can, returning only when its handler commands it to do so. Until such a command is received, the animal does its best to track its handler and any creatures with him or her, remaining hidden but within range of its sight or hearing. This trick is particularly useful for thieves and adventurers in that it allows the animal to evade capture, then return later to help free its friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Help (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;With this trick, a trainer can designate a number of creatures up to the animal’s Intelligence score as “help.” When the command is given, the animal attempts to find one of those people and bring her back to the handler, even if that means journeying a long distance to the last place it encountered the target creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Hunt (DC 20):</strong> This trick allows an animal to use its natural stalking or foraging instincts to find food and return it to the animal’s handler. An animal with this trick may attempt <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"TXrxgrB2sQjppZFY\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Survival</a> checks (or Wisdom checks if the animal has no ranks in Survival) to provide food for others or lead them to water and shelter (as the “get along in the wild” use of the Survival skill). An animal with this trick may use the aid another action to assist Survival checks made by its handler for these purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Maneuver (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;The animal is trained to use a specific combat maneuver on command. An animal must know the attack trick before it can be taught the maneuver trick, and it only performs maneuvers against targets it would normally attack. This trick can be taught to an animal multiple times. Each time it is taught, the animal can be commanded to use a different combat maneuver.</p>\n<p><strong>Menace (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;A menacing animal attempts to keep a creature you indicate from moving. It does its best to intimidate the target, but only attacks if the target attempts to move from its present location or take any significant action (particularly a hostile-seeming one). As soon as the target stops moving, the animal ceases attacking, but continues to menace.</p>\n<p><strong>Serve (DC 15):</strong>&nbsp;An animal with this trick willingly takes orders from a creature you designate. If the creature you tell the animal to serve knows what tricks the animal has, it can instruct the animal to perform these tricks using your Handle Animal 加值 on the check instead of its own. The animal treats the designated ally as friendly. An animal can unlearn this trick with 1 week of training. This trick can be taught to an animal multiple times. Each time it is taught, the animal can serve an additional creature you designate.</p>\n<p><strong>Sneak (DC 15):</strong> The animal can be ordered to make <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"T6nefKotIb5vKE9h\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Stealth</a> checks in order to stay hidden and to continue using Stealth even when circumstances or its natural instincts would normally cause it to abandon secrecy.</p>\n<p><strong>Throw Rider (DC 15)</strong>:&nbsp;The animal can attempt to fling a creature riding it to the ground. Treat this as a trip combat maneuver that applies to all creatures riding the animal, and that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An animal that knows the throw rider and exclusive tricks can be instructed to attempt to automatically throw anyone other than its trainer who attempts to ride it.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch (DC 15):</strong>&nbsp;The animal can be commanded to keep watch over a particular area, such as a campsite, and raise an alarm if it notices any sizable or dangerous creature entering the area. This trick is often included in the Guarding purpose.</p>\n<h2>New General Purposes</h2>\n<p>Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal’s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the general purpose package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.</p>\n<p>An animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks above and beyond those included in its general purpose, it may do so with the proper training. Training an animal for a general purpose requires only one Handle Animal check, but takes a number of weeks equal to the number of tricks in the general purpose package.</p>\n<p><strong>Air Support (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;An animal trained in air support knows the attack, bombard, and deliver tricks.</p>\n<p><strong>Burglar (DC 25):</strong>&nbsp;An animal trained as a burglar knows the come, fetch, maneuver (steal), seek, and sneak tricks. You can order it to steal a specific item you point out.</p>\n<p><strong>Liberator (DC 25):</strong>&nbsp;An animal trained in liberating knows the break out, flee, and get help tricks.</p>\n<p><strong>Servant (DC 20):</strong>&nbsp;An animal trained as a servant knows the deliver, exclusive, and serve tricks.</p>\n<h1>Companion Tricks</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 214</a><br>Animals can be trained to perform tricks, as detailed in the rules for Handle Animal. The following new tricks are presented in alphabetical order. Note that while the word “animal” is often used in the following descriptions, these tricks can be taught to any companion that can be trained.</p>\n<p><strong>Aid (DC 20):</strong> The animal can use the aid another action to aid a specific ally in combat by attacking a specific foe the ally is fighting. You point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to aid, and you point to another that you want it to make an attack roll against, and it will comply if able. The normal creature type restrictions governing the attack trick still apply.</p>\n<p><strong>Bombard (DC 20):</strong> A flying animal can deliver projectiles on command, attempting to drop a specified item that it can carry (often alchemist’s fire or a similar splash weapon) on a designated point or opponent, using its base attack 加值 to determine its attack roll. The animal cannot throw the object, and it must be able to fly directly over the target.</p>\n<p><strong>Break Out (DC 20):</strong> On command, the animal attempts to break or gnaw through bars or bindings restricting it, its handler, or a person indicated by the handler. If the animal cannot break the restraints by itself, its attempts grant the restricted creature a +4 circumstance 加值 on <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"AOQsMtvLY4V3wFEL\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Escape Artist</a> checks. Furthermore, the animal can take certain basic actions such as lifting a latch or bringing its master an unattended key. Weight and Strength restrictions still apply, and pickpocketing a key or picking any sort of lock is still far beyond the animal‘s ability.</p>\n<p><strong>Build 简单 Structure (DC 25):</strong> The companion can build simple structures on command, limited by its natural abilities and inclinations. The companion is able to build only structures that creatures of its type would naturally build on their own, and this trick merely allows the handler to direct the companion on when and where to build such structures. For example, a spider could be commanded to spin a web between two trees, but it could not be made to create a hammock or a tent out of silk. Similarly, a beaver could be ordered to make a dam or lodge, an alligator a dome-shaped nest, and any burrowing creature a small tunnel or hole. In general, this process takes 10 minutes for each 5-foot square the structure occupies, but depending on the terrain and the type of structure, it might take as little as 1 minute or as much as 1 hour or more, at the GM’s discretion. Only companions that naturally build structures can learn this trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Bury (DC 15):</strong> An animal with this trick can be instructed to bury an object in its possession. The animal normally seeks a secluded place to bury its object. An animal that knows both the bury and fetch tricks can be instructed to fetch an item it has buried.</p>\n<p><strong>Cocoon (DC 15)</strong>: The companion can cocoon an object or a helpless or willing Huge or smaller creature in webbing. The amount of time this takes depends on the size of the creature or object to be cocooned, as outlined on the following table.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Target Size</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Time to Cocoon</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>超小型 or smaller</td>\n<td>1 minute</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>小型 or 中型</td>\n<td>10 minutes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>大型</td>\n<td>1 hour</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Huge</td>\n<td>4 hours</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The cocoon has hardness 2 and 10 hit points. A creature trapped within the cocoon is effectively pinned, and it can attempt an Escape Artist check or combat maneuver check as a full-round action to escape (DC = 20 + the companion’s CMD). Alternatively, a DC 25 Strength check can break the cocoon. The companion must know the spin silk trick before it can learn this trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Deliver (DC 15):</strong> The animal takes an object (one you or an ally gives it, or one that it recovers with the fetch trick) to a place or person you indicate. If you indicate a place, the animal drops the item and returns to you. If you indicate a person, the animal stays adjacent to the person until the item is taken. (Retrieving an item from an animal using the deliver trick is a move action.)</p>\n<p><strong>Demolish (DC 15):</strong> The companion can be commanded to attack and damage objects and structures. A companion must know the attack trick before it can be taught the demolish trick, and the companion must be trained to attack creatures of all types. The companion’s handler can direct it either to make natural attacks against the object in question or to make a Strength check to attempt to break it (if applicable).</p>\n<p><strong>Detect (DC 25):</strong> The animal is trained to seek out the smells of air currents, alchemical items and poisons, unusual noises or echoes, and other common elements that signify the presence of potential dangers or secret passages. When commanded, the animal uses its Perception skill to try to pinpoint the source of anything that strikes it as out of the ordinary about a room or location. Note that because the animal is not intelligent, any number of doors, scents, strange mechanisms, or unfamiliar objects might catch the animal’s attention, and it cannot attempt the same Perception check more than once in this way.</p>\n<p><strong>Entertain (DC 25):</strong> The animal can dance, sing, or perform some other impressive and enjoyable trick to entertain those around it. At the command of its owner, the animal can attempt a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"HhV5UmaRLTjtB3Xh\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Perform</a> check (or a Charisma check if it has no ranks in Perform) to show off its talent. Willing onlookers or those who fail an opposed <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"R8HGxGCKayOl15AO\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Sense Motive</a> check take a –2 penalty on Perception checks to notice anything but the animal entertaining them. Once an onlooker observes an animal’s entertain trick, that creature cannot be distracted in this way by the same animal for 24 hours. Tricksters and con artists often teach their animals to perform this trick while they pickpocket viewers or sneak about unnoticed.</p>\n<p><strong>Feint (DC 20):</strong> The companion is trained to feint against opponents. A companion must know the attack trick before it can be taught the feint trick, and it performs feints only against targets it would normally attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Fetch (DC 15):</strong> The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches a random object.</p>\n<p><strong>Flank (DC 20):</strong> You can instruct an animal to attack a foe you point to and to always attempt to be adjacent to (and threatening) that foe. If you or an ally is also threatening the foe, the animal attempts to flank the foe, if possible. While animals following the attack trick will flank when convenient, this trick instructs them to flank even if doing so denies it a full attack or puts the animal companion at an inconvenience or at risk, such as from attacks of opportunity, dangerous positioning, or difficult terrain. The animal must know the attack trick before it can learn this trick, and it performs it only against foes it would normally attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Flee (DC 20):</strong> The animal attempts to run away or hide as best it can, returning only when its handler commands it to do so. Until such a command is received, the animal does its best to track its handler and any accompanying creatures, remaining hidden but within range of its sight or hearing. This trick is particularly useful for adventurers and thieves in that it allows the animal to evade capture, and then return later to help free its friends.</p>\n<p><strong>Get Help (DC 20):</strong> With this trick, a trainer can designate a number of creatures up to the animal’s Intelligence score as “help.” When the command is given, the animal attempts to find one of those creatures and bring it back to the handler, even if that means journeying a long distance to the last place it encountered the target creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Guide (DC 15):</strong> The companion can serve as a guide to a character that is blinded or otherwise unable to see. While serving as a guide, the companion remains adjacent to the guided creature at all times, readying an action each轮 to move when that creature moves. This allows the guided creature to automatically succeed at Acrobatics checks to move at more than half speed while <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.conditions\" data-id=\"coxrkb6qUKBZvVxP\"> blinded</a>. Additionally, the companion identifies obstacles in the guided creature’s path and pushes them, pulls them, or otherwise signals to the creature how to avoid them, allowing the guided creature to locate and move around obstacles such as hazards, opponents, and other terrain features as though she were able to see them (though she can’t distinguish between obstacles). Finally, while serving as a guide, the companion indicates to the guided creature the presence and direction of any adjacent allies, allowing the guided creature to pinpoint the locations of such creatures. The companion can serve as a guide only as long as it is able to see in some fashion, and its ability to detect and avoid creatures and obstacles is limited by what it is able to perceive normally.</p>\n<p><strong>Hunt (DC 20):</strong> This trick allows an animal to use its natural stalking or foraging instincts to find food and return it to the animal’s handler. An animal with this trick can attempt <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"TXrxgrB2sQjppZFY\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Survival</a> checks (or Wisdom checks, if the animal has no ranks in Survival) to provide food for others or lead them to water and shelter (as the “get along in the wild” use of the Survival skill). An animal with this trick can use the aid another action to grant a 加值 on its handlers Survival checks for these purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>Intimidate (DC 15):</strong> The companion bares its teeth, barks, bristles, growls, or otherwise threatens a creature you designate, or, alternatively, it can be trained to do so when it encounters any creature besides its handler. The companion takes a –4 penalty on Intimidate checks against creatures other than those with the animal or humanoid types unless it has also been trained to attack creatures of any type. A companion that knows this trick automatically uses the aid another action to assist Intimidate checks attempted by its handler, provided that it is within 15 feet of its handler at the time and has not been ordered to perform another task.</p>\n<p><strong>Maneuver (DC 20):</strong> The animal is trained to use a specific combat maneuver on command, even when it naturally wouldn’t do so (animals typically use combat maneuvers only when using a monster ability to make a free combat maneuver, since otherwise it would provoke an attack of opportunity). An animal must know the attack trick before it can be taught the maneuver trick, and it performs maneuvers only against targets it would normally attack. This trick can be taught to an animal multiple times. Each time it is taught, the animal can be commanded to use a different combat maneuver.</p>\n<p><strong>Mark Territory (DC 25):</strong> Whether by spraying musk, rubbing its back against trees and rocks, or simply howling loudly, the companion lets other nearby animals know that it has claimed an area. By spending 1 hour performing this trick, the companion can mark an area of up to half a square mile in this fashion. If it does so, after 24 hours, whenever there would be a random encounter within that area that involves a wild animal or other creature of Intelligence 2 or less (including vermin but not other mindless creatures, such as oozes and mindless undead), there is a 25% chance that the encounter doesn’t actually occur, as creatures might be warded off by the markings. The companion must renew any territorial markings at least once per week, or they lose their effectiveness. There is also a 10% chance per week that the markings attract the attention of a powerful predator, which actively seeks out the companion to challenge it (and its master) for the territory.</p>\n<p><strong>Menace (DC 20):</strong> A menacing animal attempts to keep a creature you indicate from moving. It does its best to dissuade the target, but it attacks only if the target attempts to move from its present location or take any significant action (particularly a hostile-seeming action). As soon as the target stops moving, the animal ceases attacking but it continues to menace.</p>\n<p><strong>Milk Venom (DC 20):</strong> The companion can be coaxed into providing a single dose of venom on command. This process takes 10 minutes, and it requires a vial or similar container in which to store the poison. A companion that has been specifically trained to be milked of its venom never bites, stings, or otherwise poisons its handler when being milked, although the handler must still succeed at a Handle Animal check to successfully harvest the venom (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Harvesting%20Poisons&amp;Category=Mastering%20the%20Wild\">Harvesting Poisons</a>). A companion must have the poison ability to be taught this trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Pose as Scenery (DC 20):</strong> The companion freezes in place, seeming to be a mundane plant rather than a plant creature. The companion must have taken root in order to use this trick. It attempts a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"lP3L1RXi9q4ha9Gu\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Disguise</a> check with a +8 circumstance 加值, opposed by the Perception checks of observers. If it succeeds at the opposed check, the observer mistakes it for an ordinary, harmless plant. The companion must have the take root trick in order to learn this trick. Only plant companions can learn this trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Receive Spell (DC 25):</strong> The companion has been trained to be the recipient of a specific spell (chosen at the time the animal is taught the trick), allowing it to fully take advantage of the spell’s effects. The spell should be one that grants the companion an ability it might not normally be intelligent enough to make use of or one that it might not even realize it has (such as <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"e4v1uv8hexeu9sxj\"> Air Walk</a>). The companion is able to recognize when it has been affected by this spell and can take full advantage of the spell’s effects. At the GM’s discretion, a companion can also be trained to receive certain nonspell effects, such as those granted by an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aonprd.com/MagicWondrousDisplay.aspx?FinalName=Elixir%20of%20Fire%20Breathing\">elixir of fire breathing</a>. The companion can be taught this trick multiple times; each time it learns this trick, it becomes trained to utilize a different spell effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Rescue (DC 20):</strong> The companion has been trained to drag its handler or another creature that the handler designates out of danger and to a safe place in the event that the handler or creature is incapacitated. If a creature that the companion is defending is rendered helpless or is slain, the companion will carry, drag, or otherwise move that creature out of danger. If the companion knows the get help trick, it will attempt to bring the creature it is rescuing to one of the creatures designated as “help.” Otherwise, you can designate a single location in advance as a safe place, and the companion will attempt to bring the creature it is rescuing to that place. If it is unable to do either of these, the companion simply moves the creature to the nearest location of relative safety. A companion must have the deliver and guard tricks in order to learn this trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Speak (DC 25):</strong> The companion is able to communicate very simple concepts through barks, gestures, whistles, or similar actions. The companion’s vocabulary is extremely limited, generally restricted to “yes,” “no,” and counting up to three. The companion is also able to recognize and respond to up to two specific questions per point of Intelligence. The companion does not so much understand the words as recognize the sound of them, and it responds accordingly. This trick does not actually increase the companion’s capacity to understand concepts and ideas; it can be taught a way to communicate the concept of “food,” for example, but it won’t distinguish cooked food from raw food, and it might not even recognize as food anything that is not part of its own diet. A companion must have an Intelligence score of 2 or higher to learn this trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Spin Silk (DC 20):</strong> The companion can create strands of delicate yet incredibly strong silk. Harvesting the silk takes 10 minutes, and it can be done once per day. This silk functions identically to a silk rope. The companion can produce a total number of feet of silk equal to 10 times its Constitution score per day, which can be divided as the handler chooses in 10-foot increments. Silk produced in this way degrades into uselessness after 24 hours. Only companions with the web ability can learn this trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Subdue (DC 15):</strong> The companion can attempt to subdue opponents. Once the command is given, the companion makes all its natural attacks as nonlethal attacks (taking the typical –4 penalty on attack rolls when using normally lethal attacks) until ordered to do otherwise.</p>\n<p><strong>Take Root (DC 15):</strong> The companion extends its roots into the soil beneath it, anchoring itself in place and drawing water and nutrients from the soil. Taking root is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. While rooted, the companion cannot move, but it can otherwise act normally and gains a +4 加值 to CMD to resist bull rush, drag, overrun, reposition, and trip attempts. If the companion remains rooted for at least 1 hour, it absorbs enough water and nutrients to feed itself for a day. A separate command causes the companion to uproot itself as a full-round action. The companion can take root only in areas of soft soil. Only plant companions can learn this trick.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch (DC 15):</strong> The animal can be commanded to keep watch over a particular area, such as a campsite, and to raise an alarm if it notices any dangerous or sizable creature entering the area.</p>\n<p><strong>Withhold Venom (DC 20):</strong> The companion can be ordered to avoid injecting poison into creatures it strikes with whatever natural attack would normally deliver venom. As long as the companion has been ordered to withhold its venom, successful hits with that natural attack deal damage as normal and convey all other effects that they normally would, but they do not expose the target to the companion’s poison. Only companions with the poison special ability can learn this trick.</p>\n<h1>Milking Venom</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 142</a><br>Venom can be harvested from a living creature without harming the creature, although the process is dangerous unless the creature has been trained for that specific purpose (see Milk Venom on page 216). For most venomous creatures, this involves stretching a thin canvas over a jar or vial and then coaxing the creature to bite into the canvas before massaging its venom glands, causing the venom to drip from its fangs into the container. Similar methods are used for creatures that deliver venom in other ways, such as with a stinger.</p>\n<p>Milking a single dose of poison from a creature takes 10 minutes of work and requires a successful Handle Animal check (DC = 10 + the donor’s Hit Dice + the donor’s Wisdom modifier). Failure by less than 5 indicates that the venom is not collected, but the handler suffers no other ill effect. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the creature bites, stings, or otherwise injects the handler with its venom. It automatically hits the handler with one of its natural attacks that delivers its poison, and it applies the effects of the attack normally. The creature might continue to attack the handler after doing so, possibly initiating combat. Milking venom from a cooperative intelligent creature doesn’t require a Handle Animal check but presents a 5% chance of exposure to the venom.</p>\n<p>A creature can produce a number of doses of venom in this way each day equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1). A creature that is milked of venom this many times in one day (whether or not the attempts are successful) loses its poison special ability until the next time it rests.</p>\n<h1>Unchained - 技能解放</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 84</a><br>With sufficient ranks in Handle Animal, you earn the following.</p>\n<p><strong>5点：</strong> Creatures you have trained gain a +2 加值 on Will saves when adjacent to you.</p>\n<p><strong>10点：</strong> Creatures you have trained gain a +2 加值 on Will saves whenever you are within 30 feet and clearly visible.

If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per轮, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him stable. A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them. First aid also stops a character from losing hit points due to effects that cause <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.conditions\" data-id=\"93aTFy7v8VUq8sNi\"> bleed</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Long-Term Care:</strong> Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points lost to ability damage at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.</p>\n<p>You can tend to as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Treat Wounds from Caltrops, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones:</strong> A creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.</p>\n<p>A creature wounded by a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"tog7q2uezhexxp92\"> Spike Growth</a> or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"hfyycpn0wdimx1n9\"> Spike Stones</a> spell must succeed on a Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim’s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC.</p>\n<p><strong>Treat Deadly Wounds:</strong> When treating deadly wounds, you can restore hit points to a damaged creature. Treating deadly wounds restores 1 hit point per level of the creature. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, add your Wisdom modifier (if positive) to this amount. A creature can only benefit from its deadly wounds being treated within 24 hours of being injured and never more than once per day. You must expend two uses from a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.items\" data-id=\"qlweoovcvtklmsre\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> healer's kit</a> to perform this task. You take a –2 penalty on your Heal skill check for each use from the healer’s kit that you lack.</p>\n<p><strong>Treat Poison:</strong> To treat poison means to tend to a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw against the poison, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the poison, the character receives a +4 competence 加值 on his saving throw against the poison.</p>\n<p><strong>Treat Disease:</strong> To treat a disease means to tend to a single diseased character. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects, you make a Heal check. If your Heal check exceeds the DC of the disease, the character receives a +4 competence 加值 on his saving throw against the disease.</p>\n<p><strong>动作：</strong> Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a&nbsp;spike growth&nbsp;or&nbsp;spike stones&nbsp;spell takes 10 minutes of work. Treating deadly wounds takes 1 hour of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.</p>\n<p><strong>重试：</strong> 可变. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without witnessing proof of the original check’s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.</p>\n<p><strong>特殊：</strong> A character with the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"8VZQJOyAXbXghxd7\"> Self-Sufficient</a> feat gets a 加值 on Heal checks (see Feats).</p>\n<p>A <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.items\" data-id=\"qlweoovcvtklmsre\"> healer's kit</a> gives you a +2 circumstance 加值 on Heal checks.</p>\n<h1>Crafting Antivenom</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 143</a><br>While antitoxin, as presented in the&nbsp;Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, presents a generalized tool for protecting oneself from poison, more specialized antivenoms can provide even greater protection against specific poisons. Creating a dose of antivenom requires a dose of the specific poison that the antivenom is designed to protect against.</p>\n<p><strong>Antivenom Effects:</strong> A single dose of antivenom automatically neutralizes the first exposure of the specific poison it is made to combat and provides a +8 alchemical 加值 on saving throws against additional exposure to that specific poison; this 加值 decreases by 1 every hour, until the effect ends after 8 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Crafting Antivenom:</strong> To create a dose of antivenom, a living creature must first be exposed to a half dose of the poison in question. The creature suffers the poison’s effects normally, except the saving throw DC to resist the poison is reduced by 2. In order to be able to produce antivenom, the creature must succeed at the necessary saving throws to be cured of the poison. If the poison’s duration expires without the creature being cured, no antivenom can be harvested.</p>\n<p>Once the creature has resisted the poison’s effects, a viable sample of the creature’s blood can be extracted with a successful DC 20 <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft (alchemy)</a> or Heal check. This blood must then be refined to extract the natural antibodies that combat the poison in a process that takes 1 hour and requires a successful <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft (alchemy)</a> check (DC = 5 + the poison’s saving throw DC). Success yields 1 dose of antivenom.</p>\n<p>Antivenom can also be harvested in the same fashion from a creature that has been afflicted by a full dose of poison, rather than a creature deliberately given a half dose for this purpose. Regardless of how much poison the creature is exposed to, the antibodies in its system can be harvested only for 24 hours after it has recovered from the poison.</p>\n<p><strong>Purchasing Antivenom:</strong> Antivenom is not particularly expensive, but because it is highly specialized, it can be difficult to find. A dose of antivenom has a market price equal to half the market price of a dose of the poison in question, but it is treated as though its price were five times the market price of the poison for the purposes of determining its availability in any given settlement. Alternatively, if 1 or more doses of the poison in question can be provided, most alchemists will supply as much antivenom as they can produce from the doses for a fee of 10% of the market price of the poison.</p>\n<h1>Faith Healing</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Occult Adventures pg. 195</a><br>You apply esoteric principles to temporarily suspend or remove curses, diseases, and ability damage.</p>\n<p><strong>检定：</strong> You can use faith healing once per day. The DC and effect of the Heal check depend on the task you attempt. You can’t use faith healing on yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Restore Vitality:</strong> You suppress ability damage. You perform a 1-hour ceremony, after which you attempt a Heal check against the DC of the effect that caused the ability damage. If you succeed at the check, you temporarily suppress 1 point of ability damage for 1 hour, plus 1 additional point and hour for every 5 by which the check result exceeds the DC. A creature can benefit from this treatment no more than once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>Suspend Affliction:</strong> You treat one curse, disease, or poison affecting a creature. You enter into a deep trance for 1 hour while you treat the subject, after which you attempt your Heal check. If the check is successful, you suspend the effects of the affliction by 1 hour, plus 1 hour for every 5 by which you exceed the DC. This time doesn’t count against the effect’s duration (if any). The affliction can still be cured by other means while it’s suspended.</p>\n<p><strong>Remove Affliction:</strong> You can attempt to permanently remove an affliction in an 8-hour ceremony, after which you attempt a Heal check. If the result of the check is at least double the DC of the original affliction, the sufferer can attempt another saving throw using the original DC to permanently cast off the effect.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">任务</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Restore vitality</td>\n<td>Effect’s save DC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Suspend affliction</td>\n<td>Affliction’s save DC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Remove affliction</td>\n<td>Double the affliction’s save DC</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>动作：</strong> Restoring vitality and suspending afflictions each require 1 hour in a quiet environment. Permanent removal of afflictions requires 8 hours of heavy activity.</p>\n<p><strong>重试：</strong> 可变. A creature can’t be the subject of faith healing more than once per day. You can’t try to permanently remove an affliction again.</p>\n<h2>Occult Skill Unlocks</h2>\n<p>Characters capable of casting psychic spells or who have the Psychic Sensitivity feat gain access to skill unlocks—a host of esoteric skill uses not available to other PCs. These are not entirely new skills, but rather new uses of existing skills for those trained in the occult arts. A character must be trained in the appropriate skill to use that skill’s unlock, even if the skill can normally be used untrained. It’s impossible to take 10 for an occult skill unlock. Occult skill unlocks require intense concentration and strenuous effort, so the amount a character can use each skill unlock is limited to once per day or per week. This limit is for all uses of the skill unlock; if a character uses hypnotism to implant a suggestion, he can’t also use it to recall memories on the same day.</p>\n<h1>Researching 科技</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy95d2?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Technology Guide pg. 5</a><br>A character can use the Heal skill to&nbsp;identify and understand pharmaceuticals.</p>\n<h1>Unchained - 技能解放</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 84</a><br>With sufficient ranks in Heal, you earn the following.</p>\n<p><strong>5点：</strong> When you treat deadly wounds, the target recovers hit points and ability damage as if it had rested for a full day.</p>\n<p><strong>10点：</strong> When you treat deadly wounds, the target recovers hit points as if it had rested for a full day with long-term care.</p>\n<p><strong>15点：</strong> When you treat deadly wounds, the creature recovers hit point and ability damage as if it had rested for 3 days.</p>\n<p><strong>20点：</strong> When you treat deadly wounds, the target recovers hit point and ability damage as if it had rested for 3 days with long-term care.</p>"

The DC is typically modified by the subject’s Hit Dice. With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet.

These are not entirely new skills, but rather new uses of existing skills for those trained in the occult arts. A character must be trained in the appropriate skill to use that skill’s unlock, even if the skill can normally be used untrained. It’s impossible to take 10 for an occult skill unlock. Occult skill unlocks require intense concentration and strenuous effort, so the amount a character can use each skill unlock is limited to once per day or per week.

This requires 10 minutes of concentration, after which you attempt a Perception check. Each time, you must pick one of four auras to read: alignment, emotion, health, or magic. The result of the check applies only to the selected aura. You must be within 30 feet of the subject at all times during the reading. Objects typically have only magic auras, though some also have alignment auras (and intelligent items have emotion auras). You can still attempt to detect a type of aura an object doesn’t have, but you get no results. The DC varies depending on the aura, as shown on the table.</p>\n<p><strong>Read Alignment Aura:</strong> You attempt to read the alignment aura, learning the alignment and its strength. An alignment aura’s strength depends on the creature’s Hit Dice or item’s caster level, as noted in the description of the detect evil spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Read Emotion Aura:</strong> The colors within the target’s aura reveal its emotional state. If successful, you learn the target’s disposition and its attitude toward any creatures within 30 feet of it.

You also learn the total number of points available in its ki pool, grit pool, or similar resource.</p>\n<p><strong>Read Magic Aura:</strong> You attempt to determine the number and power of all magical auras on a target creature or object (see&nbsp;detect magic&nbsp;to determine a magic aura’s power). If the check is successful, you can attempt Knowledge (arcana) or Spellcraft checks to determine the school or identify properties of a magic item, as normal. If the item is affected by&nbsp;magic aura&nbsp;or a similar spell, you can realize this and determine the actual properties of the item if your check result exceeds the DC by 5 or more.

These are not entirely new skills, but rather new uses of existing skills for those trained in the occult arts. A character must be trained in the appropriate skill to use that skill’s unlock, even if the skill can normally be used untrained. It’s impossible to take 10 for an occult skill unlock. Occult skill unlocks require intense concentration and strenuous effort, so the amount a character can use each skill unlock is limited to once per day or per week. This limit is for all uses of the skill unlock; if a character uses hypnotism to implant a suggestion, he can’t also use it to recall memories on the same day.</p>\n<h1>Unchained - 技能解放</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 85</a><br>With sufficient ranks in Perception, you earn the following.</p>\n<p><strong>5点：</strong> You remain alert to sounds even in your sleep, and the normal DC increase to Perception checks when you are sleeping is halved.

If you gather herbs while traveling, your overland speed is halved. Spending 8 hours doing nothing but gathering herbs from the area grants 1 additional yield of each herb you’re gathering.</p>\n<p>When you start your day of herb gathering, you must declare which herb you are looking for. If you have 5 ranks of Profession (herbalist), you can search for two different types of herbs at once, and for each additional 5 ranks you have in this skill, you can search for one additional herb, to a maximum of 5 herbs at once if you have 20 ranks in Profession (herbalist).</p>\n<p>Each herb listed below has a gather DC. At the end of the time spent gathering, attempt a Profession (herbalist) or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"ki0QvL0K7u4YuK0O\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Knowledge (nature)</a> check against each herb’s gather DC. If the terrain you are searching in is one of your favored terrains, you can attempt a Survival check instead. If the herb in question is present in the region you searched (this is always subject to the GM’s discretion), success results in a single yield of that herb. Success by 5 or more grants 1 extra yield. Success by 10 or more grants 2 extra yields.</p>\n<p>A single yield of herb weighs 1/10 of a pound unless otherwise noted in its yield section in the stats below.</p>\n<p>In addition to determining whether a particular herb is available to gather in a region, the GM also determines how many attempts to gather that herb can be attempted in the region. Typically, a region can support 1d4 herb-gathering expeditions before the herbs must be given 2d6 months to regrow.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparing Herbs:</strong> Most herbs must be prepared to unlock their potency. If this is the case for an herb, its stat block describes the method required to process it, the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft (alchemy)</a> DC to accomplish this task, and the amount of time needed to do so.

If the preparer fails this check by 5 or more, the dose of the herb is ruined; if she fails by less, she can try again with the same herbs.</p>\n<p><strong>Preparing Multiple Herbs:</strong> An herbalist can normally prepare one type of herb per day, but she can prepare a number of doses of that single type of herb equal to her ranks in Profession (herbalist). An herbalist with 7 or more ranks in Profession (herbalist) can simultaneously prepare a second type of herb. At 14 ranks in Profession (herbalist), the character can prepare up to three types of herbs at the same time.</p>\n<p><strong>Herb Lifespan:</strong> A raw, unprepared herb spoils 24 hours after it is harvested.

Alternatively, you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.</p>\n<p><strong>Sense Enchantment:</strong> You can tell that someone’s behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect even if that person isn’t aware of it. The usual DC is 25, but if the target is dominated (see <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"q070n0zoq3zojpas\"> Dominate Person</a>), the DC is only 15 because of the limited range of the target’s activities.</p>\n<p><strong>Discern Secret Message:</strong> You may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case, your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of the character transmitting the message. For each piece of information relating to the message that you are missing, you take a –2 penalty on your Sense Motive check. If you succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is being communicated, but you can’t learn anything specific about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or less, you don’t detect any hidden communication. If you fail by 5 or more, you might infer false information.</p>\n<p><strong>动作：</strong> Trying to gain information with Sense Motive generally takes at least 1 minute, and you could spend a whole evening trying to get a sense of the people around you.</p>\n<p><strong>重试：</strong> No, though you may make a Sense Motive check for each Bluff check made against you.</p>\n<p><strong>特殊：</strong> A ranger gains a 加值 on Sense Motive checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.</p>\n<p>If you have the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"Q1cY8r0Pvb66pMG0\"> Alertness</a> feat, you get a 加值 on Sense Motive checks (see Feats).</p>\n<h1>Prognostication</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Occult Adventures pg. 196</a><br>You are skilled in means of folk divination. The most common methods are cartomancy (reading cards), cheiromancy (reading a creature’s palms), crystallomancy (crystal-gazing), extispicy (reading animal entrails), horoscopy (reading a creature’s birth stars), oneiromancy (interpreting dreams), osteomancy (reading cast bones), and pyromancy (reading flames).</p>\n<p><strong>检定：</strong> Once per day, you can predict a creature’s fortune for the near future. You spend 10 minutes interpreting the divination means at your disposal. The GM then attempts a secret Sense Motive check with a DC modified by the subject’s Hit Dice (see the table below). The result of the check can give you basic insight into the subject’s nature, including its alignment, class, and levels or Hit Dice, and might reveal clues to the creature’s immediate future. Determining the immediate future as an&nbsp;augury&nbsp;spell has a chance of successfully interpreting meaningful readings equal to 60% plus 5% for every point by which the check result exceeds the DC (to a maximum of 90%). With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet. For instance, if you had a result of 22 when telling the fortune of a creature with 2 HD, you would learn that creature’s alignment and class, but not its level, HD, or fortune.<br><br></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">任务</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine alignment</td>\n<td>15 + creature’s HD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine class</td>\n<td>20 + creature’s HD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine level or HD</td>\n<td>25 + creature’s HD</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine fortune as <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"d1wxnax51cecplm4\"> Augury</a>&nbsp;spell</td>\n<td>25 + creature’s HD</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>动作：</strong> Reading a creature’s fortune requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted contemplation, and the subject creature must be present.</p>\n<p><strong>重试：</strong> Yes.

These are not entirely new skills, but rather new uses of existing skills for those trained in the occult arts. A character must be trained in the appropriate skill to use that skill’s unlock, even if the skill can normally be used untrained. It’s impossible to take 10 for an occult skill unlock. Occult skill unlocks require intense concentration and strenuous effort, so the amount a character can use each skill unlock is limited to once per day or per week. This limit is for all uses of the skill unlock; if a character uses hypnotism to implant a suggestion, he can’t also use it to recall memories on the same day.</p>\n<h1>Unchained - 技能解放</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 86</a><br>With sufficient ranks in Sense Motive, you earn the following.</p>\n<p><strong>5点：</strong> If you were aware of an opponent before rolling initiative (such as when you ambush an enemy or negotiations break down into combat, but not when both sides happen upon each other or you are surprised), you can attempt a Sense Motive check as part of your initiative check (DC = 11 + the highest <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"pAB2PYkZO3lsmeaC\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Bluff</a> modifier among your opponents or DC 15, whichever is higher).

You can’t salvage materials from artifacts, cursed items, or items you can’t destroy. Successfully salvaging an item requires a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft</a> or Spellcraft check and takes an amount of time as indicated in the specific type of salvage operation below.</p>\n<p><strong>Ammunition:</strong> You can use destroyed ammunition as raw materials for new ammunition. Five pieces of destroyed ammunition provide suitable material to create one new piece of ammunition using the normal crafting rules.</p>\n<p><strong>Potions:</strong> If you have the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"nNVFVFRBCT4O2ab9\"> Brew Potion</a> feat, you can combine natural catalysts with a potion to salvage it and create a different potion of a lower spell level. Salvaging a potion requires raw magic item materials (these can be salvaged from existing items, as detailed below). To salvage a potion, you must spend 1 hour per spell level of the original potion and then attempt a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft (alchemy)</a> or Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 15 + 3 × the original potion’s spell level. If you succeed, you transmute the original potion into a new potion of a spell at least one spell level lower, provided you know the spell in question (it need not be one you can currently cast). If you fail this check by 4 or less, the attempt fails and the catalyst is wasted, but the potion is unharmed. If you fail by 5 or more, the raw materials are lost and the original potion is ruined.</p>\n<p><strong>Raw Crafting Materials:</strong> Anyone trained in the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft</a> skill can salvage raw materials from equipment for use in crafting or repair. You must carefully dismantle the item to be salvaged, resulting in the item’s destruction. If the item’s price is 1 gp or less, its materials can be salvaged with only 1 hour of work; otherwise it takes 8 hours to salvage crafting materials. A successful Craft check against the item’s creation DC + 5 yields raw materials worth one-quarter the item’s price. If you fail the Craft check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed but the materials can still be salvaged in a future attempt. If you fail the Craft check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the materials are ruined. Salvaged raw materials can be used to create or repair any item of the same materials and reduces the construction time by the proportion of the new item’s raw materials that are salvaged (minimum 8 hours).</p>\n<p><strong>Raw Magic Item Materials:</strong> Anyone with an item creation feat can salvage the raw materials from magic items for the creation of new ones or repair of existing ones. You must have the item creation feat required for that item to salvage its raw materials. Each attempt requires destroying a magic item and 8 hours of work. If the item’s price is 500 gp or less, you can salvage its materials in only 2 hours. A successful <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft</a> or Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the item’s caster level yields raw materials worth two-thirds the creation cost of the destroyed item (one-third the market price). If you fail the skill check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed but the materials can still be salvaged in a future attempt. If you fail the skill check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the materials are ruined. Salvaged raw materials can be used to create or repair any item made of similar materials or that shares any of the creation requirements as the original. Including the majority of the materials allows you to automatically meet any construction requirements of a new item that the salvaged item also required and reduces the construction or repair time by the proportion of the new item’s construction materials that are salvaged (with the usual minimum creation time). Spellbooks and formula books can be salvaged for magic inks and paper usable in formula books, scrolls, and spellbooks.</p>\n<p><strong>Costly Spell Components:</strong> Anyone trained in Spellcraft can salvage costly material or focus spell components from magic items. Each attempt requires destroying the item and 8 hours of work. An item can be broken down into a powder that can be used in place of gemstone dust as a material component. Otherwise, the item must have a spell requiring the component in its construction requirements to salvage that component. A successful Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the item’s caster level yields materials usable in place of that spell component worth two-thirds the item’s creation cost (one-third its market price). If you fail the check by 4 or less, the item is destroyed without yielding spell components, but you can try to salvage them again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the item is destroyed and the spell components are ruined.</p>\n<h1>Unchained - 技能解放</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 86</a><br>With sufficient ranks in Spellcraft, you earn the following.</p>\n<p><strong>5点：</strong> Identifying magic items takes 1 full轮, and the time required to learn a spell from a spellbook is halved.</p>\n<p><strong>10点：</strong> You can identify magic items without using detect magic, though the DC is increased by 10.</p>\n<p><strong>15点：</strong> Identifying magic items is a standard action, and the time required to learn a new spell from a spellbook is reduced to 1 minute per spell level.</p>\n<p><strong>20点：</strong> Whenever you attempt a caster level check, attempt a Spellcraft check at a –20 penalty at the same DC.

These are not entirely new skills, but rather new uses of existing skills for those trained in the occult arts. A character must be trained in the appropriate skill to use that skill’s unlock, even if the skill can normally be used untrained. It’s impossible to take 10 for an occult skill unlock. Occult skill unlocks require intense concentration and strenuous effort, so the amount a character can use each skill unlock is limited to once per day or per week. This limit is for all uses of the skill unlock; if a character uses hypnotism to implant a suggestion, he can’t also use it to recall memories on the same day.</p>\n<h1>Foraging</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 134</a><br>These foraging techniques assume a search in a typically bountiful wilderness area. The exact time required to forage for supplies depends on the specific supplies desired and the type of terrain being searched, as does the DC of the skill check to successfully forage, as listed on Table 4–4 below. As a general rule, a character who spends more than 8 hours per day foraging becomes fatigued.</p>\n<p>The base amount of time required to forage for supplies depends on the type of supplies you’re searching for, as listed in each supply category below. When foraging, multiply this base time by the terrain’s “forage factor” as listed on the table below. Whether the terrain in question counts as standard, barren, or abundant depends on the type of terrain being searched, what is begin searched for, and the GM’s discretion (for example, a remote shoreline may qualify as abundant for the purposes of foraging for tools and weapons, but barren for the purposes of foraging for herbs), but in most cases, the standard category should be used. Rugged terrain includes all terrain with difficult physical obstacles (numerous steep mountainsides or cliffs, particularly dense undergrowth, or any other terrain where the searcher’s movement type is impeded), and its forage factor stacks with other forage factors for different types of terrain.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Type of Terrain</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Forage Factor</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Forage DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Standard</td>\n<td>×1</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Barren</td>\n<td>×2</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Abundant</td>\n<td>×1/2</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Terrain is rugged</td>\n<td>×2</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Time spent to forage for supplies need not be consecutive and can be split over multiple days. Once the required time has passed, attempt a skill check against the appropriate forage DC as indicated on the table above; typically this is a Survival check, but searching for some types of supplies sometimes allows the substitution of a different skill.</p>\n<p>When a character attempts to forage for supplies, he must choose what kind of supplies he is searching for from the broad categories detailed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Alchemical Supplies and Material Components:</strong> Many alchemical supplies and material components can be found in the wilderness. You can forage enough supplies to approximate the contents of an alchemy crafting kit or a spell component pouch with a successful Survival check and 2d4 hours of effort, but the GM can rule that certain components simply aren’t available in an area (for example, bat guano cannot be foraged in terrain where no bats live). If a component is unavailable in the area but its cost remains negligible, you can create a rudimentary substitute component from your foraged supplies with a successful <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft (alchemy)</a> or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"uLZI2uWz0uB8UgBc\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Spellcraft</a> check and 1 hour of effort (DC = 15 + double the level of the extract or spell). An extract or spell cast with such an improvised substitute has a 20% chance of failure (in addition to any other chance of failure). Focus components or costly material components cannot be foraged.</p>\n<p><strong>Herbs:</strong> Foraging for specific herbs requires a <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"ki0QvL0K7u4YuK0O\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Knowledge (nature)</a> or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"O7Utk8xKbHYDP7Ot\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Profession (herbalist)</a> check and follows special rules, as presented on page 152 of this book.</p>\n<p><strong>Repair Materials and Improvised Tools:</strong> A period of 1d6 hours and a successful Survival check are enough to forage rudimentary supplies to perform field repairs for damaged equipment when the proper tools and supplies are not available. On a successful check, a character gathers the equivalent of 2d6 gp in raw materials. She must still spend the time and attempt <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft</a> or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"uLZI2uWz0uB8UgBc\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Spellcraft</a> skill checks as normal to use these materials to repair an object, but she takes a –5 penalty on the check due to the foraged nature of the materials used.

At the GM’s discretion, other improvised weapons can be foraged.</p>\n<h1>Harvesting Poison</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 142</a><br>While some think of poison as an assassin’s tool, the herbalists and naturalists of the world know that poison carries in it no more inherent evil than fire or water. Indeed, in the wildlands of the world, harvesting poison to give a hunter an edge or to aid in the production of antivenom is a time-honored practice.</p>\n<p>While <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Craft (alchemy)</a> is necessary to brew long-lasting poisons, there are many natural sources of poison in the world, and poison crafters who wish to avoid the expense of purchasing raw ingredients may seek to harvest poison from natural sources instead. The following section presents rules for harvesting poisons from the wild.</p>\n<p>Unless a dose of harvested poison is preserved (see Preserving Harvested Poison on page 143), it remains potent for 24 hours after it is harvested.</p>\n<h2>Harvesting from Dead Creatures</h2>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 142</a><br>Once a venomous creature is slain, its venom sacs can be removed, allowing 1 or more doses of its venom to be harvested for later use. In order to harvest venom, the creature must have been dead for less than 24 hours. Every hour the source creature has been dead reduces the lifespan of the harvested poison by an hour. Removing venom sacs is a messy and timeconsuming process, requiring 10 minutes of work, access to surgical tools, and a container to store the venom in. If proper surgical tools are not available, a dagger or other light slashing weapon can be used, although this imposes a –2 penalty on checks to harvest the venom. The harvester must succeed at a Survival check (DC = 15 + the dead creature’s CR) in order to successfully harvest poison. On a success, the harvester acquires a single dose of the creature’s venom, plus 1 additional dose for every 5 by which the result of this check exceeded the DC (to a maximum number of doses equal to the creature’s Constitution modifier, minimum 1). Failing the check causes all of the venom to be lost. Failure by 5 or more exposes the harvester to 1d3 doses of the creature’s venom unless she has the poison use class feature.</p>\n<h1>Harvesting Poison from Hazards</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9ujo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ultimate Wilderness pg. 142</a><br>Some hazards, such as poison oak and spider vines, feature poisons that can be harvested by those who know how to do so.

If the harvester succeeds at a Survival check (DC = 15 + the hazard’s CR), she collects 1 dose of poison.

The trap affects only creatures of a single size category, determined when the trap is constructed. (小型er creatures slip out easily, and larger creatures are too big to be effectively snared.) The trap is obvious unless it is hidden with a successful DC 20 Stealth check, in which case noticing it requires a successful DC 15 Perception check. The trap’s DC is 13, it has 10 hit points, and it can be burst with a successful DC 15 Strength check. If left unattended, a simple trap has a 25% chance of becoming ineffective each day.</p>\n<p>Characters who wish to create more effective traps should invest skill ranks in Craft (traps) or take the Learn Ranger Trap feat.</p>\n<h1>Unchained - 技能解放</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 87</a><br>With sufficient ranks in Survival, you earn the following.</p>\n<p><strong>5点：</strong> You reduce all nonlethal damage you take from heat, cold, starvation, or thirst by 1 point for every 5 ranks you possess in Survival.</p>\n<p><strong>10点：</strong> You can track creatures that leave no tracks, including flying and swimming creatures and creatures using trackless step or pass without trace, taking a –20 penalty on your Survival check.</p>\n<p><strong>15点：</strong> Once per day, you can spend 1 hour and attempt a DC 30 Survival check.

Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.</p>\n<p>You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.</p>\n<p>You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">任务</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Use Magic Device DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Activate blindly</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decipher a written spell</td>\n<td>25 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Use a scroll</td>\n<td>20 + caster level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Use a wand</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emulate a class feature</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emulate an ability score</td>\n<td>See text</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emulate a race</td>\n<td>25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Emulate an alignment</td>\n<td>30</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Activate Blindly:</strong> Some magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you’re not and even if you don’t know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a +2 加值 on your Use Magic Device check if you’ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can’t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but doesn’t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally risk when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Decipher a Written Spell:</strong> This usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.</p>\n<p><strong>Emulate an Ability Score:</strong> To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.classes\" data-id=\"0c4lYDywj6bQ0i8r\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> wizard</a> spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.classes\" data-id=\"AoWSbnuTSGIxmv61\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> sorcerer</a> or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.classes\" data-id=\"6GjOjO6r3R06fLwE\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> bard</a> spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don’t need to make this check.</p>\n<p><strong>Emulate an Alignment:</strong> Some magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user’s alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Emulate a Class Feature:</strong> Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).</p>\n<p><strong>Emulate a Race:</strong> Some magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a member of a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a Scroll:</strong> Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll’s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don’t have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check.</p>\n<p>This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.</p>\n<p><strong>Use a Wand, Staff, or Other Spell Trigger Item:</strong> Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand’s spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. Failing the roll does not expend a charge.</p>\n<p><strong>动作：</strong> None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.</p>\n<p><strong>重试：</strong> Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can’t try to activate that item again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>特殊：</strong> You cannot take 10 with this skill. You can’t aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.</p>\n<p>If you have the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"CLSsMyNmdcNAOUKC\"><i class=\"fas fa-suitcase\"></i> Magical Aptitude</a> feat, you gain a 加值 on Use Magic Device checks (see Feats).</p>\n<h1>Intentional Mishap</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2w?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Spymasters-Handbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spymaster's Handbook pg. 8</a><br>You can intentionally cause a magic item to produce a mishap.</p>\n<p><strong>检定：</strong> You can cause a magic item to have an intentional magic mishap, as if you had attempted to activate it blindly and failed by 10 or more. The DC to produce an intentional mishap is 30. If you succeed, you have some control over the mishap. The item deals 2d6 points of damage to any one creature or object that the item could have targeted if activated normally. You can attempt to aim it, but if you select an invalid target, you take the damage instead. If you fail the check by 9 or less, you create a normal mishap you do not control. If you fail by 10 or more, nothing happens.</p>\n<p><strong>动作：</strong> Attempting to create a mishap is like activating an item blindly, and requires a standard action during which you try out magic words or other appropriate actions.</p>\n<h1>Unchained - 技能解放</h1>\n<p><strong>来源</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 87</a><br>With sufficient ranks in Use Magic Device, you earn the following.</p>\n<p><strong>5点：</strong> You can use the aid another action to assist another creature’s Use Magic Device check by attempting a check against the item’s Use Magic Device DC.</p>\n<p><strong>10点：</strong> If you roll a natural 1 when activating an item, you take a –10 penalty on Use Magic Device checks with that item for 24 hours instead of being unable to activate it. This penalty stacks with itself.</p>\n<p><strong>15点：</strong> You can use this skill to emulate two races or two alignments simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>20点：</strong> If you roll a natural 1 when activating an item, you can reroll the check at a –10 penalty to activate the item.
